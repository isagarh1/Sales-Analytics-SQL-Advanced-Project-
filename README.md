# Sales-Analytics-SQL-Advanced-Project-
## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive, end-to-end SQL analytics implementation designed to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights. The objective was to model business questions, derive meaningful KPIs, and perform multi-dimensional analysis using structured SQL queries.

The analysis covers sales performance, customer behavior, product contribution, trend analysis, and segmentation, enabling data-driven decision-making for revenue growth, product optimization, and customer strategy.

## Business Objectives

Measure overall business performance using core revenue and volume metrics

Identify top- and bottom-performing products

Understand customer distribution and contribution

Analyze sales trends over time (yearly and monthly)

Evaluate category-level impact on total revenue

Perform customer and product segmentation for strategic insights

## Key Metrics Discovered
Metric	Value
Total Sales Revenue	29.36 Million
Average Product Price	486.04
Total Quantity Sold	60,423 Units
Total Orders	27,659

## This project goes beyond reporting by explicitly connecting analytical activity to business action and quantified outcomes.
